Ban a user from logging into their wordpress account, suspend posts and send notifications. The perfect solution for managing users and blocking unwanted registrations. 

== Description ==

<h4>WP Plugin for truly banning users!</h4>
<p>The BAN Users WordPress Plugin has been developed to enable administrators to quickly BAN (aka disable, suspendâ€¦) users from logging into their WordPress user account, as well as the option to change the status of all their posts. For instance setting them to draft to hide them from public viewing. A user can be BANed from the admin users table or via their profile. There are several configurable options that allow the administrator to control how the BAN will be implemented such as redirecting them to a custom holding page, or sending them a custom email notification. Once BANned they will be unable to login until an administrator reinstates their account.</p>

<h4>How is it Useful?</h4>
<p>There are multiple reasons why an administrator of a WordPress website may need to block users. One of the most popular reasons is the security of the site. Indeed, most blogs face security issues. Once your site is online and growing in popularity, it can become the target of individuals whose only goal is to destroy your work and to discredit your blog. The BAN Users Plugin enables administrators to deny access to unwanted individuals, and inform those users of the actions taken against them.</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to ban malicious users from logging in.</li>
<li>You want to ban users who have breached terms of use or another policy.</li>
<li>You want to temporarily control access to admin.</li>
<li>You want to restrict a registered user from making any changes during development.</li>
<li>You have a client/user who has an unpaid invoice.</li>
<li>Ideal solution for moderators who monitor wordpress forums/posts.</li>
</ul>

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Go to Users->All Users to view the list of users.

4a. Click on a username to access their profile page, or hover over the user and select 'Edit'.
5a. Scroll down to the 'Account Management' Section of the profile page.
6a. Click on the checkbox which says 'Ban this User' beside it to either ban or unban the user.
7a. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select 'Update User' to confirm the changes made to the user.

4b. Hover over a user to display a list of possible modifications.
5b. Press the 'Ban' / 'Unban' button in order to change the users current state.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can all users be banned, regardless of role? =

Yes, anyone can be banned by an administrator. Administrators are not able to ban themselves however.

= Who can ban / unban another user? =

Only Administrators are allowed to ban / unban other users by default.

= How will I know if another user is banned? =

In the user edit page, the user will be marked in a checkbox in the row called 'Ban User'. If you also hover over the user on the 'All Users' page, the user will be the opposite of the stated 'ban' / 'unban' button.

= How can I get unbanned? =

You will need to contact a website administrator and asked to be unbanned. Each website may have their own policy for banning / unbanning users. If all administrators are banned, remove the plugin manually. Make sure an administrator is logged in on the website. Reinstall the plugin but with 'force_logout' set to false (0) and 'custom message' also set to false (0) in the settings file. The administrator can then unban people as usual.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.3.7 =
If using the 'Ultimate Member Plugin' you will need to tick the checkbox 'Ultimate Member Plugin' under the '3rd Party Plugin Support' section in Ban Users settings page. This is because ver 1.3.7 of the Ban Users plugin now allows you to enable/disable support - as required - for 3rd Party code; but doesn't assume support by default. However, I've included a check so that until the new Ban Users settings are saved, it will continue to automatically support the 'Ultimate Member Plugin' so your sites don't break during this update.

= 1.0.1 =
Initial release
